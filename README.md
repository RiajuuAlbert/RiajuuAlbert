### Albert Setiawan, usually called Albert

I am currently a student majoring in Biological Engineering at [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://www.itb.ac.id/).
I see myself as an aspiring person that loves to learn anything new, and this is shown by my interest in programming, capital markets, photography, among many others. I am currently learning on how to live my life happier, and I am currently working on my thesis for my final year project, titled "Active Compound Isolation from Propolis Produced by Stingless Bees Cultivated in a Controlled Environment". I am very open to discussion regarding many topics, especially in regards to capital market investments and data science.
