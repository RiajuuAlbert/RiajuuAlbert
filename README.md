You are currently learning briefly about myself.

I am currently a student majoring in Biological Engineering at [Bandung Institute of Technology](https://www.itb.ac.id/).
I see myself as an aspiring person that loves to learn anything new, and this is shown by my interest in programming, stock markets, photography, and many others.
